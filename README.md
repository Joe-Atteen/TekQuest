## <a name="about">🤖 About the Project</a>

TekQuest is a community-driven platform inspired by StackOverflow, enhanced with AI-powered answers, gamification, recommendations, and more. I used the latest features of Next.js, exploring rendering strategies like SSG, ISR, SSR, PPR, Server Functions, Caching, & Revalidation to create this production-ready application.

The project uses MongoDB for a robust database layer, NextAuth (Auth.js) for versatile authentication options (Email/Password, GitHub, Google), and sleek styling with TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI. TekQuest enables developers to ask questions, post answers, leverage AI for responses, vote, organize content, contribute, discover jobs, and explore recommended topics—all while engaging with gamified elements like badges and rewards.
